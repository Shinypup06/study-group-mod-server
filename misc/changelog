  - Made a better navbar for all the current existing pages. There are some bugs that I will fix later.
  - The subpages will have a smaller navbar.
  - In case we make more pages (which we probably will), turned all the CSS of the smaller navbar into its separate file.
    - In order to use it, just link it in the <head> section. You still have to copy/paste the html part though.

<!--    Well, hi I guess!! Here's some notes for whoever wants to expand on this page.
        btw, just for reference, I like to embed the CSS and js in the html file. So, 
        the CSS n js code is at the bottom of this file, just scroll down! -Shiny -->

<!--    Here's a list of things to work on this file in the future: -->

    <!--1.  the loadMain function needs to be linked to server side. 
            Currently, it only works for username "Admin" and password "123456".
            More instructions provided where the loadMain function is declared.
            IMPORTANT- make sure you don't directly declare any of the usernames/passwords
            in a list in the html code. THIS MUST ALWAYS BE STORED SERVER-SIDE.
            otherwise, someone could just click inspect and steal everyone's login
            info. -->

    <!--2.  Not sure if it has to do directly with the code for this file, but
            we need to make sure for all the other files that:
                if (sessionStorage.getItem("loggedIn") != "True"){
                    [some function that redirects you to login page immediately]
                }
        
            This essentially ensures that if you're not logged in, you can't access
            any pages of the website (otherwise login would be a mood point). I would
            add this to every page other than this current login one once server side
            is up and running.-->

    <!--3.  We need to create a "sign up" page. Don't worry about this too much for now,
            I'm working on it! :)  -->
    
    <!--4.  Actually, now that I think about it, this login page looks kinda naked with just
            a box in the middle. Help me think of ideas of what to put in the background-
            should we keep the nav bar just so it doesn't look empty or fake?-->
